        My name's Jay and I'm a BSc (Hons) Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence student at the University 
        of Sussex. Initially wanting to become a full-time musician, falling into this course was first just an 
        excuse to live in the coastal city of Brighton, but as time went on, I recognised the importance and power 
        of computation to solve real world problems, and a fascination grew quickly.

    I studied Computer Science at college for a couple of years and that was enough to know that I'd enjoy the 
    subject as a backup career, hence why I decided to pursue it at university. However, one month into my first 
    year and something completely switched within me. I wanted to learn as much about Computer Science and surrounding 
    subjects as possible, quickly replacing open mics with taking notes from lectures on YouTube.

    I decided to start a blog so I could pin my research and rambles to a dedicated place. The topics I cover will 
    vary from one post to another, though they will mainly reside in the STEM area. This is an attempt to document 
    the journey of how I find answers to questions that I don't even know how to approach.
